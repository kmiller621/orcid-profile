## What you will learn:

* Register for an ORCID account and activate it (or look up an existing ORCID)
* Sign in to your ORCID account and edit your profile by populating basic account fields
* Apply desired privacy settings to the data in your ORCID profile
* Enter works in your ORCID profile using three different approaches:
    * Enter a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) 
    * Use the Search & Link tool 
    * Upload a BibTex citation 
* Compare displayed citations from various input approaches and recognize display differents based on different data sources
* Register for an author profile with a third party system (eg, ScienceOpen, ImpactStory, MySciEnCV) using your ORCID number.
* Observe that the third party profile auto-populates with data in your ORCID account.

## Requirements

Author Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient
workflow.

*Before* working through this lesson you will need: 

* Three citations to your works, including at least two with Digital Object Identifiers issued by CrossRef. 
* For demonstration purposes in this lesson, we are using the "Works" entries publicly displayed on [Hugh Shanahan's ORCID profile](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1374-6015) at [https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1374-6015](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1374-6015). For the BibTeX exercise, we use the shen.bib file created in the [DOI](https://kmiller621.github.io/dois-citation-data/) lesson.
* Hugh is co-chair of the [CODATA-RDA schools in Research Data Science](http://www.codata.org/working-groups/research-data-science-summer-schools) so thank him for allowing us to 'borrow' his publications for testing purposes during the School at [DataTrieste19](http://indico.ictp.it/event/8706/)!

## Tips

If you are not sure that your publication's DOI was issued by the CrossRef DOI Agency, visit the [CrossRef Metadata Search](https://search.crossref.org/). On the 'Search Metadata' tab, enter the DOI number starting with the '10' prefix. A record will display if the DOI was issued by CrossRef.
